<h1>
  image

<p>
The <em>image</em> of a function is its output. I've always found this technical
term to be quite beautiful. The function is a lens, static and frictionless,
pure existence, and the universe is a flow through it. There's no
<em>flowing</em>, just <em>flow</em>, there's just a universe, a lens, and an
image. To me the urge to write things down feels like the urge to just be a
lens. I don't want to do anything, I don't want to have a purpose or a goal or
affectation, I just want to be a lens with an image, and I want to be empty.
