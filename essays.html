<h1>
  thinking about the future
</h1>

<p><em>This essay is a work in progress.</em></p>

<p>
I'm 33 years old. I'm a very-good-but-not-exceptional software developer, I've
worked mostly meh jobs but also co-founded a startup. The startup recently
failed after two years and I'm thinking about my professional future. I'm
thinking of it as three distinct phases and I'm working backwards from the end.
</p>

<p>
<em>Phase 3</em> is a steady state, it's the end goal, it continues until I can't. In
<em>Phase 3</em> I'm an angel investor. I'll be plugged into a strong network of
talented, compassionate, forward-thinking operators. My professional life will
be mostly learning, discussing, writing, tinkering, connecting people, and
writing checks. Before I can be this future me there's a few mountains to
climb. I need to master my craft, apprehend the world, meet tons of people, and
make a grip of money. The first three mountains are a lot of hard work but also
trivial. The last mountain is dicey.
</p>

<p>
My view on getting rich is that it's trivial if you live as if it's the most
important thing (regardless of talent), it's trivial if you start very early
(and are exceptionally talented), and it's trivial if you have strong ties to a
powerful network (and are not an idiot). Otherwise, getting rich is very
nontrivial, it requires a mix of talent, effort, focus, and luck (and lots of
it). For me that means I've got to focus, work hard, and hope for the best. If I
never make it to <em>Phase 3</em>, but I try my best, that'll be ok. That said, I'd
love to be in <em>Phase 3</em> on my 50th birthday.
</p>

<p>
<em>Phase 2</em> is about accessing <em>Phase 3</em>. At some point in my career
I'll be a principal engineer or equivalent on a reasonably sized team working on
a <em>real product.</em> I don't wanna get sucked into defining a “real” product
but, basically, it's something that <em>isn't obviously bullshit.</em> The
easiest (but not the only!) way to prove a product is real is if its existence
is completely funded by its users in one way or another. Other than making <em>a
lot</em> of money, there's a few motivations behind this goal. First, I have a
chip (or two or three) on my shoulder and I want to prove myself to myself.
Also, I don't think I could ever truly <em>master my craft</em> without working
on at least a few large systems. Finally, I don't think I could ever really
understand the <a href="/dynamo.html">dynamo</a> having never worked at scale.
</p>

<p>
At some point in my career I'll create and operate a successful company. Success
to me means <em>actually profitable</em> to the world. I'm not interested in tapping
the <em>hypergrowthosphere</em>'s flows. The motivations behind this goal are similar
to those for becoming a principal engineer. Basically I expect to prove
something to myself, learn a lot, and make enough money to enter <em>Stage 3</em>.
</p>

<p>
If I never start a company but run a respectable engineering team and make
enough money to live as an investor, I'll be happy. If I start a company and go
straight from founder to investor that would be amazing too. If I spend the rest
of my life honing my craft, building useful things, and meeting new people,
that's great too. The only fundamentally important goal to me is effort and
intentionality, the rest is bonus. If I work really hard, and find one or two
great jobs, I think I can launch <em>Phase 2</em> in 5 or 6 years (let's say by my 40th
birthday). Man, do I feel old. 
</p>

<p>
<em>Phase 1</em> is right now and it's about preparing for, or growing into,
<em>Phase 2</em>.  The meat and potatoes of <em>Phase 1</em> is working every
day to improve my craft.  Right now, and for the foreseeable future, this is a
three-pronged endeavor.  First, I have to work on products that I care about in
roles where I'm learning <em>a lot</em>. Second, I need to maintain at least a
couple real open source projects. Last, I need to consistently work through
books and on projects that push the boundaries of my knowledge. For example,
I've been recently writing a programming language and learning golang.
</p>

<p>
Today is New Year's Day 2024. After 2 years of ups and (mostly) downs my startup
failed two months ago in late October. It's time to get back in the arena. I've
been working on some cool stuff these past months but I don't think any of my
active projects are ready to become startups, so I need to get a job. I've
always embraced the grind but I've never embraced the selling. I've always
pushed myself in private but never pushed myself in public. For example, I've
been accepted by every single school and every single job I've ever applied to
because I've never applied to something that was out of my comfort zone.
Starting today, I'm going to change that. I'm going to try as hard as I can to
get a job that I'm convinced I will not get. I have a family, so I need a job,
so I'll cap my efforts at 30 days and 100 jobs before I tone down my
requirements.
</p>

<p>
And that's all there is to it, time to get started.
</p>

<h1>postscript</h1>
<p>
I've also thought a lot about a <em>Phase 4</em> where I
<s>transcend humanity's exigencies and vicissitudes</s> reach out beyond
software, start some small businesses, and work really hard for my community. If
money weren't a problem I'd skip the first three phases, for sure. I'll write
about "Phase 4" in another essay.
