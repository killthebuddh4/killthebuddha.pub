<h1>
  dynamo
</h1>

<p>
  A dynamo is a device that generates electric power. I don't know anything more
  than that about what is a dynamo. I hear “dynamo” and in my head there's a
  whirling and an output. This format is also how the world works, in my head.
  Everybody knows the world is <em>infinitely complex</em>, but I'm not so sure. I have a
  feeling it's really just a whirling and an output. The world is a dynamo and I
  want to understand its whirling, its <em>simple</em> dynamics. I think it might be
  simple like a music might be simple even when it's complex. Music is emergent,
  it's a whirling and an output. If you dive into the core and apprehend the
  dynamics, you can <em>intuit the whirling</em>, you can do the things musicians do.
  Project dynamo is my attempt to develop and cultivate an intuitive understanding
  of the world's whirling. I know I will probably fail.

<h1>a starting point</h1>

<p>
  <em>
  First, consider the world as N semiautonomous interdependent regions. Then,
  for each region, consider the following questions:
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  What are the key geographical features? What kind of seasonal variation
  exists?
</p>

<p>
  What are the most salient natural boons and banes to life? What makes life
  easy and what makes life hard?
</p>
<p>
  How many people are there? How much food do they produce? How much water do
  they have access to? How much free energy is lying around?
</p>
<p>
  What do they sell? Who do they sell it to? Who else sells the stuff? Between
  the buyers and sellers, who has the leverage?
</p>
<p>
  What do they buy? Who do they buy it from? Between the buyers and sellers,
  who has the leverage?
</p>
<p>
  Who are the economic power players, i.e who is doing the selling? Are they
  private or public? Are they foreign or domestic? If they're foreign, how much
  leverage do the locals have?
</p>
<p>
  What does the infrastructure look like? How are the roads, the waterways, the
  power grid, and the education system? Are there any major universities? What
  kind of healthcare is available? What about financial services?
</p>
<p>
  What are the major cultural denominations? Are they religious, ethnic,
  socioeconomic? What are the key differences between the region's populace and
  their neighbors'?
</p>
<p>
  Who are the political power players? Whence do they derive their powers? What
  alliances and conflicts are they actively engaged in? What is the basic
  political architecture in the region? How much violence are they capable of?
  Do they have nukes?
</p>
<p>
  Which of the answers 1-9 can be mostly explained given mostly geographic
  priors? Which answers only make sense when you remember some kind of historical
  path dependency?
</p>
<p>
  How quickly are things changing? What are the catalysts? Are they endogenous
  or exogenous? Are they designed or mechanical?
</p>

<p>
  Piece of cake. Now, where to start?

  the global village construction set
</h1>

<p>
  I was tumbling down a solarpunk rabbit hole and discovered the <a
  href="https://opensourceecology.org">Open Source Ecology (OSE) project</a> and their
  <em>global village construction set</em> (GVCS). The GVCS is a collection of
  50 machines that together could bootstrap a modern civilization. The OSE is on
  a mission to design, document, and develop fully open source versions of each
  of the 50 machines. So sick. Unfortunately it doesn't look like they're making
  a ton of progress (or maybe the scope is just so massive). But even if they
  don't succeed, I at least think the list itself is a great resource. If you
  want to scale the <a href="/dynamo.html">dynamo</a>, what better anchor point
  than its 50 central machines!?
