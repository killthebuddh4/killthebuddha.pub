<h1>
dunk
</h1>

<p>
I'm going to be pretty bummed if I never dunk a basketball. I'm also very
unlikely to ever dunk a basketball. I definitely could have when I was younger
if I had trained for it, but as a pretty serious soccer player I never focused
much at all on my hops. I'm 5'11" and 270 lbs (for me, this is roughly 50 pounds
overweight). When I was 19 or 20, on a perfect attempt I could get my whole
middle finger over the rim, but that was my peak. If I decide today to get back
in shape and I do so via some kind of plyometric or jump training routine, then
by the time I lose 50ish pounds, I might have a shot. Let's say it takes 2
years. How many 35-year-old 5'11" guys dunk a basketball for the first time?
Zero? Probably. But I'm going to try.
