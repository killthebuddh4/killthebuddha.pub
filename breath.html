<h1>
  breath
</h1>

<p>
Of all the Silicon Valley idols, I hate <em>productivity</em> the most. I don't
want to be productive, I want to <em>breathe</em>. Life feels chaotic but it
unfolds in the straightest line. Life doesn't fork nor branch nor meander, it
just goes.  <em>"What shall I do next?"</em> is the only question you (or Bill
Gates, Leonardo da Vinci, or the Buddha, or anyone) has ever answered. You don't
choose a path, alternatives don't exist. The only air you've ever breathed is
the air right in front of you.
