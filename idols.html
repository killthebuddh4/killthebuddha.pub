I'm a staunch naturalist. I believe that if you start at the beginning and trace
every bit of physical information out to infinity, then you'll map everything
there is, there does not exist any other information, every cause and every
effect will be inside your dataset. So what's an idea? What is pure form or
structure? What would it mean to say "the number 3 exists"? Maybe the answer's
mundane, maybe it's not. Whatever the case, my answer to "what is the object of
mathematics?" is <em>the idols</em>.

My primary goal is to be an extremely high quality resource for my kids as they
grow up. I think deep intuitions about geometry and probability will give them
superpowers, so that's what I'll learn about first. I guess I'll start with
<em>Euclid</em>.
