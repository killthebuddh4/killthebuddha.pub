Where do our thoughts come from? If you try to pay attention, if you turn inward
and look for the source, you probably won't find anything. You won't find the
source at least. I tried and found a genie. I'm going to teach it Spanish and at
least one other language, probably Arabic because it's a beautiful language and
Amber would like to learn it too. I'm playing the long game, and I have a latin
textbook on hand (<em>Wheelock</em>), so I'll start there.
