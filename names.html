  names

<p>
In <em>the Kingkiller Chronicle</em> the most ancient and powerful art is naming. A
master namer knows the true name of a thing and has power over it. To study
naming you assume a posture and look closely at the world. The posture is like
skillfulness and the looking is like intuition.  I've also heard it said that
the visual arts are more about sight than craft.  The role of craft is to
develop a clear channel between the world and the medium. I think this is the
same idea. I want to learn to look closely and pay attention, I want to be a
namer. I'll try charcoal and paper.
