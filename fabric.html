I feel like it would be irreligious to never study general relativity, quantum
mechanics, the standard model, and cosmology. It would be like an affront to the
creator. I'm never going to be a <em>physicist</em>, but I am going to be
<em>old</em> and I'm going to be an example to my family and others. How can I
be a good example if I don't have a basic understanding of fundamental physics?
I don't know enough physics right now to know what my process should be so I'm
going to just start somewhere. I will work through <em>the Theoretical
Minimum</em> by Susskind and also <em>the Feynman Lectures</em>. I also want to
read through Wheeler's <em>Gravitation</em> which is in my opinion the most
beautiful book I've ever owned. I don't expect to "finish" this project for a
long time. My goal is to be able to talk to my oldest son about these topics by
the time he's ready, so maybe 15 years from now.
