<h1>
  source
</h1>

<p>
Rick Rubin talks a lot about <em>Source</em> in his new book. Source is the
thing that is, the thing that artists communicate. I'm a little bit different,
maybe. For me, Source is the Reason. For me, Source is the world and other
people. For me, Source is Life, or the Good Life, or something like that. Maybe
that's the same Source, I guess.

One of the more important lessons from my childhood is that unhappy people
don't do well. I have a hard time connecting with Source, and I'm kind of an
unhappy fellow. But I know that, whatever I do, if I don't show my children the
face of happiness, if I don't expose them to the Source, I'll have failed them.
