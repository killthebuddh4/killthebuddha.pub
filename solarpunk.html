  solarpunk
</h1>

<p>
  I've never liked labels but <a href="/">solarpunk</a> is starting to grow on
  me. I've always had a <em>fuck you</em> attitude towards institutional
  authority but a deep appreciation for institutions. This contradiction says a
  lot about me and the way I think, I think.
</p>

<p>
  Recently I was reading Ivan Illich's <em>Tools for Conviviality</em> and it
  hit me: "This is what I want to do with my career, I want to build software
  tools for conviviality". Illich wrote in the 1970s, it may be the case that
  <em>solarpunk tools</em> markets better today, but the ideas seem to spring
  from the same source and flow in the same direction.
</p>

<p>
  Illich uses the term <em>tool</em> to mean (basically) any synthetic thing.
  This includes hammers and computers but also institutions, conventions, and
  culture. I want to build tools that amplify human talent but don't obviate it.
  To some extent, this is impossible. To some extent, it's necessary.
</p>

<p>
  I want to understand what amplifies and what obviates, and how much, and what
  are the second- and higher-order effects, and which modern institutions are
  "solarpunk compatible" and which are not, and what technology is being
  developed, and what scientific breakthroughs are needed, and how can I
  orientate myself and my family towards a more convivial or solarpunk future,
  and... well, I'll stop there. I have a lot of questions and a lot of reading
  to do, maybe a lifetime's worth.
