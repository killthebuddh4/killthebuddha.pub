<h1>
  about me
</h1>

<p>
I like to be creative, spend time with my family, and work hard. I'm a software
engineer by trade. I like sunsets and cold drinks. At night I like to read. I'm
way too proud of being left-handed. I think Socrates got it mostly right, Plato
got it mostly wrong, and Hegel was out to lunch. I hope my kids will be happy,
skillful, compassionate, and family-oriented.
